						<h3>Business Goal</h3>
						<p>We live in a time in which physical contact can be unsafe or impossible. COVID-19 has added new challenges to our everyday communication and exacerbated existing problems. Now more than ever, we want and need to check in with those we love and show appreciation for one another. Graditap is our solution to these issues. The social smartphone application uses three senses (sound, vision, and touch) to engage users in meaningful communication. Building on contemporary social media applications, users can send sound messages, photos, and vibration messages. Vibration messages utilize smartphone haptics and vibration features to deliver a feeling of closeness with loved ones that otherwise may not be possible.</p>
						<div class="row">

								<h3>Domain</h3>
								<p>Our target domain includes people who want to connect with one another and those who have been separated from friends and family due to COVID-19. We wanted to provide a solution that did not focus on a specific age group, but rather those who needed a quick and simple way to check in with their loved ones. With COVID-19 being the biggest influence on the activities for our target group, sharing meaningful messages through different senses (touch, sight, sound) can help combat loneliness and touch deprivation in those who live in isolation. <br><br>
									Our target user group is people who have been affected and isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we hope this app can be used by others who simply wish to connect. With our proposed solution being quite broad and heavily relying on senses, it is important to keep in mind users who may have sensory impairments. That is why our solution supports engagement of multiple senses, and the decision of which senses to engage is decided by the users. <br><br>
									Those who are hard of hearing or d/Deaf can feel the vibrations and interact with visual aspects of the solution. Many apps rely solely on visual aspects and those who have visual impairments cannot always participate with those interfaces. Our solution, though it has visual aspects, allows users to fully rely on auditory and vibration features if desired.<br><br>
									At its inception, our solutions’ essential functions to support connection with friends and family through different senses in a customizable app flow would include: a feature to connect with loved ones no matter the distance or location, ability to enable push notifications so users get alerted when contacted, and having the ability to alter the sense engagements in the app.<br> <br>
									There are several apps and technologies currently available that allow for quick communication between loved ones utilizing different communication channels, including texting, sending pictures and video messages, and emojis. These are all great channels for communication through various senses; however, many of these solutions can be committal, cumbersome, time-consuming, and/or expensive. Is there a way to utilize some of these channels of communication and send them through a simplified interface and experience?</p>

								<h3>Interview Process</h3>
								<p>Users were asked if they were able to complete a 45-60 minute interview for research regarding digital communication. Interviews were conducted either in person or via video calls (Zoom and FaceTime) from September 27, 2021, through October 6, 2021. Some researchers used recording apps such as Otter.ai or Voice Memo.<br><br>

									Following our interviews, we each transcribed our data, facts, and quotes onto digital sticky notes in a Miro board. We each then sorted those notes into a table with columns that represented major ideas in our questions. We then created an affinity diagram to further analyze our user data. Here, we organized by demographics, motivations, goals/desires, frustrations, and common applications.<br><br>
							
									Most users reported keeping in touch with only a few close friends and/or family on a daily or semi-weekly basis. Some who are employed reported communicating with a large population of people at work but have relatively low amounts of communication in their personal lives.<br><br>
									Users reported a wide variety of applications they use to communicate with loved ones. Texting (iMessage and native texting apps) and FaceTime were most used amongst users. Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Kakao, Zoom, Discord, and Signal were mentioned a few times as main forms of communication. In addition, most users also mentioned multiple different applications they use for smaller, less significant interactions with loved ones, such as Snapchat, Marco Polo, TikTok, Reddit, and Instagram.

									<h3>Design Process</h3>
									<p>
										Our goal in the design process was to create a simple app that allows you to make meaningful conversations with your distant loved ones. We do not want the app interface to get in the way of this goal, so the basic design builds upon structures present in other contemporary social applications and has a minimal number of pages. To facilitate meaningful communication, we used the idea of the three senses that are engage-able via a smartphone: sound, touch, and vision. We decided to make those three core engagements the primary navigation for users. Users tap on the corresponding button to open a message page. Each message page has the same basic layout but has unique interactions to the type of message one is sending. <br><br>
										For voice messages, the user presses the button to begin a recording and presses it a second time to end the recording. The user can then play the audio back, start over, or send the audio to a friend. The photo message page is a simple camera page, similar to that native of a smartphone. The vibration message engagement is two-fold: tactile and visual. To start the message, the user taps the button. The user can then choose to simply tap a pattern on their device to create a vibration pattern; or they may also choose a pen (and pen color) to draw a picture to send along with a vibration, which will match the touch strokes used when drawing the picture.
										The home screen consists of two main elements: the user’s list of friends and messages, sorted in order of most recent, and the bottom navigation. Two other forms of navigation are at the top of the home screen: adding friends and account/system settings. Other features we built in were a detailed account creation flow, multiple user settings, and some add friend functionality. We then conducted usability testing on this low-fidelity prototype. <br><br>
										Feedback received from testers identified several issues. The first issue was a lack of display feedback on user’s actions. The low-fidelity prototype did not account for enough feedback features to let the users know what tasks they have accomplished. For example, most of them were related to technical issues of prototyping, such as the lack of feedback display when creating vibration messages and confirmation buttons after sending a message. A second issue arose around the placement of the interaction to change the user's profile photo. These insights were valuable as we transitioned into making our high-fidelity prototype.

										<h3>Final Design</h3>
										<p>Our final prototype incorporated feedback from three usability tests and continued to build upon the structure formed with low-fidelity prototypes.
											To improve our feedback on our users’ actions, text instructions were added in the layout for guiding the users. Other improvements made include adding a functional toggle button, checkboxes, and dropdown menu for the pronouns selector.
											Usability testing on our high-fidelity prototype raised two design flaws: one was confusion on the notification system and second was no flip camera option in the photo message page. Users expressed that the notification system felt too complicated and might benefit by being simpler like Snapchat.</p>

											<h3>Takeaways</h3>
											<p>Future work should revolve around polishing the finer details of our prototype, such as the flaws discovered in our last round of usability testing, and implementing the more advanced design requirements (GIF implementation, reactions to messages, etc.). The adding friends feature also needs to be built out more to include other advertised features.
												The biggest limitation of this exploration was time. This project deserves to have more focus, and with our team’s schedules as students and some working long hours at other jobs, there were limitations on how far we could explore the idea. Another limitation of this project was our technical abilities. For most of us, this was our first time using Adobe XD. Learning to prototype for the first in a time crunch certainly limited the amount of polish we were able to put into the project.</p>
