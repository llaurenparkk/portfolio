								<h3>Choosing from many options.</h3>
								<p>Going to school right by Shenendoah NP made me grow a strong love for the outdoors. If we were free during the weekends my friends and I would pack the car and go camping. Now there has been instances when the weather was unpredictable and sleeping methods have failed us, however through the multiple trial and error weekends, we became experts by our senior year. </p>

								<p>The first time my friends and I went camping, it was during the month of December, and my friend was eager to use their 10 person tent for the first time. We arrived at our spot, set up the tent and once midnight hit, all anyone could hear were teeth chattering noises. Turns out, it was designed as a summer tent. We left within the hour of laying our heads down.</p>

								<p>Having an RV was a dream of mine and still is but as long as my back is okay, I will sleep in a tent on the ground. The first time I slept in a camper, I was impressed with how luxurious and  the expereince was, however, it took 10 times longer to hook up an RV and set it up for the night than a regular tent. Overall, it was not the expereince I was looking forward to.</p>

								<p>I thought hammocking would be ideal when backpacking but unless you have a tarp while wearing a rainjacket, you and your gear will get a nice natural shower.</p>

								<p>I haven't tried car camping yet but it sounds the most ideal, however with my Honda Civic - not so much. The closest thing to car camping was my road trip from Virginia to Colorado with my Beagle. It was okay, I didn't have the most sufficent space in the world but I was doable. Definitely must try again with a something other than a sedan. </p>

								<h3>The UX in Putting Up a Tent</h3>

								<p>After years of spending my life outdoors, my favorite way to camp is by using an everyday basic Coleman tent. Putting it up is easy. It is fun. And an overall blissful experience and continues to be. </p>
								
								<p>	But, what really struck me from putting up a tent is how well thought-out the whole design had been. From the way the tent was put up, to the way cords were secured by stakes, and to the positioning and size of integrated pockets, the whole tent presented itself as more than well-designed.

									The whole product and the process of using it has been and still continues to be pure joy. This tent is more than I expected and one of the best products I have ever used. I enjoy seeing that someone has put a lot of thought and effort into a product that I get to experience.</p>

								<p>In my work as UX designer, I want to support the user. I want to provide my customers with products that are thought through. I strive to satisfy a userâ€™s need. I enjoy the process of gathering requirements and building up on the data, with one goal in mind: the ultimate service and product. But through my camping experiences, I have learned that there is always something to optimize and extend. As a User Experience Designer, I can always get a little bit closer to what my users and customers expect.
									Sure, sometimes I have to compromise and sometimes I even fail to design a great product. Nevertheless, whenever I see our tent I am reminded that great product design is what I want to achieve.</p>
